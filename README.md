# Peruvian Ministers Network (2005-2023)

This project focuses on mapping the network of Peruvian ministers from Alan García’s second administration (2005) to Dina Boluarte’s government in 2023. It analyzes two key variables: the university from which each minister graduated and their region of origin. The repository contains all the relevant data and code for calculating and visualizing the network, with a final summary highlighting the most significant findings.

Warning: This is primarily a code exercise. The data was AI-generated and has not been fully fact-checked, so it may contain inaccuracies.
