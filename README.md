# Peruvian Ministers Network (2011-2016 / 2021-2022)

This project focuses on mapping the network of Peruvian ministers from Ollanta Humalasâ€™s presidential term (2011-2016) and Pedro Castillo's government (2021-2022). It analyzes two key variables: the university from which each minister graduated and their region of origin. The repository contains all the relevant data and code for calculating and visualizing the network, with a final summary highlighting the most significant findings.

Warning: This is primarily a code exercise. The data was AI-generated and has not been fully fact-checked, so it may contain certain inaccuracies.
